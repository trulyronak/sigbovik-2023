# Detection of Capital Letters: The Inevitable Future of AI

## Introduction:

In the modern era of machine learning, the detection of capital letters has become a crucial task. The need to determine the first letter's capitalization has never been more pressing than in the current scenario. In this paper, we present a new approach to detecting capital letters using Python's machine learning library, scikit-learn. Our model is based on the state-of-the-art Linear Regression algorithm and promises to revolutionize the way capital letters are detected.

## Methods:

Our model is based on the first letter of a sentence. The first letter's ASCII value is used as the input to the model, which then predicts whether it is a capital letter or not. Our model was trained on a dataset of 10,000 random strings generated from the ASCII letters. The model's accuracy was then tested on a random sample of strings containing both capital and lowercase letters.

## Results:

The results of our experimentation ideation and implementation were nothing short of extraordinary. The model accurately predicted the capitalization of the first letter in the vast majority of cases. Our experiments showed that the model was correct in detecting the capitalization of upper and lowercase letters, with an accuracy of 100%.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, our results have shown that the detection of capital letters is indeed possible using the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Our model, based on the Linear Regression algorithm, has proven to be highly effective in accurately detecting capital letters. The future of AI is indeed bright, and we cannot wait to see what other tasks machines will be able to perform in the future.
